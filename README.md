# Building Trustworthy AI :bank:: <br>The Crucial Role of Explainabilty and Bias Elimination 
According to a recent PwC technology survey, 73%[^1] of US companies have integrated AI into some aspect of their operations, with this trend expected to accelerate. In the finance industry, AI tools are increasingly being used for critical functions such as fraud detection, customer personalization, risk management, and portfolio optimization, among others (refer to [figure 1](https://impact.economist.com/perspectives/sites/default/files/aiinfinancialservices.pdf)). 

Parituclarly for CIBC, having Canada's #1 rated mobile banking app, just annouced, starting this August, a 12-month strategic collaboration with and participation in **_Putting AI to Work Program_** held by Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) to better serve clients and enhance efficiencies [^2]. At the same time from Bloomber News[^3], Christina Kramer, the bank's head of technology and innovation, also revealed that CIBC plans to hire more than 200 sorkers in data and AI over the next year as it continues development in pilot programs using generative AI.

As we could see how important AI usage is for CIBC, some potential factors behind should catch up attention when utilizing data to build such impactful systems.
